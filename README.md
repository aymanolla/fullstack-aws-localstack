## Features

- **Local Development**: Simulate AWS services like Lambda, SQS, SNS, and more.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with CloudWatch and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- **Data Storage**: Use MinIO for object storage, mimicking AWS S3 functionality.
- **Reactive Programming**: Implement reactive programming patterns with Spring WebFlux.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use AWS services to build event-driven applications.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Angular, React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, WebFlux
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, LocalStack, SNS, SQS
- **Monitoring Tools**: CloudWatch, Grafana, Prometheus
- **Data Storage**: MinIO

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aymanolla/fullstack-aws-localstack.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fullstack-aws-localstack
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   For Angular:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   For Spring Boot:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./mvnw install
   ```

4. Start LocalStack:

   You can use Docker to run LocalStack. Ensure you have Docker installed and run:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 localstack/localstack
   ```

5. Run the application:

   Start the backend service:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   Then start the frontend service:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ng serve
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the frontend at `http://localhost:4200`. You can interact with various AWS services through the LocalStack interface.

### Example Workflows

- **Sending Messages with SQS**: You can send and receive messages using SQS. Use the frontend interface to test message queuing.
- **Event Notifications with SNS**: Set up topics and subscriptions to simulate event-driven architectures.
- **Data Storage**: Upload files to MinIO and access them through the application.
